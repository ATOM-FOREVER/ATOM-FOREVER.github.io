                Your birthday is actually one of the least remembered dates in my list
                if I'd be honest. All I can do is wish for your good fortune and may you
                get a job where you don't get disappointed and get paid as you like,
                after all you have take care
                of your parents so i wish you all the best. I know we don't speak at all
                and i don't answer your calls or anyone's but I'm here always. Just dm
                me whenever you are in trouble or you need anything other than a girl
                (cause i can't find someone who stays as some people are temporary).
                I'll be right there to help you, ofcourse not physically but I can try
                to help in every way possible. See ya buddy when things get better.
